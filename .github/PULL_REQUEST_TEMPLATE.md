**Is the solution complete?**

[Yes]

**Did you run into any problems?**

[I guess the main problem I had was not knowing how to test for special characters, because these special characters are characters that are not a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. I didn't know the syntax of regex that would allow me to do that. I was trying to use the ! since I was used to using this symbol to negate inequalities and similar notations. However, doing /![ a-zA-Z0-9]/ didn't work. Accordingly, in order to understand how regex worked fully, I decided to research online on how to use regex expressions. This led me to see that you can use the ^ symbol to negate things in a regular expression. As such, I leared that you can use /[ ^a-zA-Z0-9]/ to target special characters.

**Did you collaborate with others on this solution?**

No, I didn't collaborate with anyone.
